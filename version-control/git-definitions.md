# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control allows you to view/make revisions to a repository in Git/GitHub and merge them with a master repository.  It is useful to allow multiple people to work on different parts of a project and then merge them together to the master branch at a later time without messing up one another's work.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is like an arm of a repository where a copy of the master repository is made and work on a specific part or section can be done.  It is used to allow many individuals to work on a project at one time and then merge the changes/work later back to the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is when work on a branch is merged with the master branch.  A good commit message will have some relevant details of the work that was done on the added branch so that others can see and understand the work after the commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict comes up when two or more people all make changes/commits to the same line of code in the master branch on their own working branches.  Git does not know which change or version to go with so it sends an error message (usually with >>>>>>> all over the place!) and then the team decides to choose one of the versions or delete all versions that were committed.
