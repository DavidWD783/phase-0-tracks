#Plan for jQuery

##Spend 5 minutes looking for cheat sheets and references for jQuery

##Spend 10-15 minutes looking at example code in the resources
###Additional 5-10 mins to implement code in my own practice files

##Spend 15 mins writing pseudocode in my own files for what I want to create
###Spend 20-30 mins looking up jQuery functions, methods, etc... and add to pseudocode
###Spend 10 mins testing

##Spend 20-30 mins refactoring and implementing other jQuery methods and functions

##Spend remaining time testing and refactoring


#Reflection on jQuery learning
##It took a lot longer than expected to find a way to link the jQuery library into my computer and my .js file.  My initial plan should have said "30 minutes for unplanned 'getting stuck time'."
##I found helpful resources for practicing the animate feature (I can do the other ones in vanilla js just fine) so I spent the bulk of my time here.
##In 2 hours, it's hard to say that writing a program to move a block across the screen is a good use of time, but it was my objective and I got it to happen.
##I tried to pseudocode as best I could without knowing a real direction at the start; that's usually the case and is something I need to practice more of.
##All in all, I feel WAY more comfortable using jquery now than I did 2 hours ago, so I think it was a success.
