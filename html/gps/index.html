<!--  The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags is to be something for engineers and those working on the project code to notice.  There is no difference between a div and a section but having the semantic name is helpful when looking through code to know which part to work on.  Each one is applied to a different type of work (aside for definitions, article for listing/referencing articles) and can be found more easily with the tag.  I like the nav, header, and footer tags the most and see myself using them most often (along with main, of course!) -->
<!--  The order the browser uses is main, header/nav, section/article/aside, footer with their inherited tags (h1, div, img, a) all following suit within each one.  At the top of the page the browser reads the !doctype declaration, then html, then head/title, then body before all else though. -->
<!--  I really like the snippets and will definitely use them!  I learned that sublime is a powerful tool to not only add/input code but also reference saved/stored code snippets to become a fast webpage production aid.  I also learned about accessibility and how to put different tags (code, ...) in sublime to output font differently.  -->
<!--  I did not struggle with a concept so much as struggling to get my git/github sorted at the start and then I did not understand how to initiate a snippet initially.  Once those were sorted this was a very helpful exercise! -->
